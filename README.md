Order Statistics Filters
In image processing, filter is usually necessary to perform a high degree of noise reduction in an image before performing higher-level processing steps. The order statistics filter is a non-linear digital filter technique, often used to remove speckle  (salt and pepper) noise from images. We target two common filters in this 
## project:
1.	Alpha-trim filter
2.	Adaptive median filter
The main idea of both filters is to sort the pixel values in a neighborhood region with certain window size and then chose/calculate the single value from them and places it in the center of the window in a new image, see figure 1. This process is repeated for all pixels in the original image.
 
## Figure 1: Main idea of order-statistics filters
As the window size increased, the effect of the filter is increased, as shown in figure 3.

## FIRST: Alpha-trim filter
The idea is to calculate the average of some neighboring pixels' values after trimming out (excluding) the smallest T pixels and largest T pixels. This can be done by repeating the following steps for each pixel in the image:
1.	Store the values of the neighboring pixels in an array. The array is called the window, and it should be odd sized.
2.	Sort the values in the window in ascending order.
3.	Exclude the first T values (smallest) and the last T values (largest) from the array.
4.	Calculate the average of the remaining values as the new pixel value and place it in the center of the window in the new image, see figure 1.
This filter is usually used to remove both salt & pepper noise and random noise. See figure 2
Notes
•	We work on gray-level images. So, each pixel has a value ranged from 0 to 255. Where 0 is the black pixel and 255 is the white pixel.

## SECOND: Adaptive Median Filter
The idea of the standard median filter is similar to alpha-trim filter but instead we calculate the median of neighboring pixels' values (middle value in the window array after sorting). 
It's usually used to remove the salt and pepper noise, see figure 3.
However, the standard median filter has the following drawbacks:

1.	It fails to remove salt and pepper noise with large percentage (greater than 20%) without causing distortion in the original image.

2.	It usually has a side-effect on the original image especially when it’s applied with large mask size, see figure 2 with window 7×7.
Adaptive median filter is designed to handle these drawbacks by:

1.	Seeking a median value that’s not either salt or pepper noise by increasing the window size until reaching such median.

2.	Replace the noise pixels only. (i.e. if the pixel is not a salt or a pepper, then leave it).
This is clear in figure 4 and figure 5. Compare the effect of both filters in each case. Note that both can remove the noise, but adaptive filter don’t cause large distortion on the original image as the standard filter do.

Implementation steps of Adaptive Median filter on Image
Adaptive median filter has variable window size WS, and the procedure of updating the pixel value is as follows:
For each pixel in the image: 
Try window sizes ranging from 3×3 to WS × WS, where WS is the maximum window size entered by the user, as follows: 

- Step 0: Start by window size 3×3

- Step 1: Chose a non-noise median value 

- Sort the current window, and denote the following:

1.	Zxy is the gray value of the current pixel value at location (x, y)

2.	Zmax is the maximum gray value in the window.

3.	Zmin is the minimum gray value in the window.

4.	Zmed is the median gray value in the window. 
A1 = Zmed – Zmin
A2 = Zmax – Zmed 
If A1 > 0 and A2 > 0 then we found a non-noise median
	Go to Step 2
Else
	Increase window size by 2
	If new window size ≤ WS then
		Repeat Step 1 again
	Else
		NewPixelVal = Zmed		
- Step 2: Replace the center with the median value, or leave it
B1 = Zxy – Zmin
B2 = Zmax – Zxy 
If B1 > 0 and B2 > 0 then
	NewPixelVal = Zxy		//leave the center pixel as it is
Else
	NewPixelVal = Zmed		//replace the center pixel with the median value

- Step 3: repeat the process for the next pixel starting from step 0 again

 
The steps above summarize what’s done through adaptive median filter implementation. The meaning of these steps is as follows:
- Step 1: Search for a true median
IF the current window has a true median (i.e. Zmed is different from Zmin and Zmax)  THEN  
	//Execute  Step 2 
ELSE
            	IF the current window size is not the maximum 
               		 Increase it and repeat Step 1
             	ELSE
  		Let the output pixel be Zmed and move to the next pixel.
           	 ENDIF
EndIF
- Step 2: if we have a true median
IF (Zxy is different from Zmin and Zmax) (i.e. not noise)
THEN      
	Let the output pixel be Zxy (i.e. not changed) and move to the next pixel.
ELSE
             	Let the output pixel be Zmed and move to the next pixel.
 
## Project Requirements
- FIRST: alpha-trim filter with TWO different algorithms: 
1.	Counting Sort

2.	Selecting Kth smallest element in the array without sorting it (Textbook sec. 9.2). where K = T to exclude the smallest T values, then on the remaining array, apply the algorithm again to exclude the largest T values. Finally, calculate the average of the remaining values

- SECOND: adaptive median filter with TWO different algorithms: 
1.	Quick Sort

2.	Counting Sort

- THIRD: timing graphs
1.	Display two graphs to show the execution time against different window sizes (3, 5, 7,… Wmax), where Wmax is user input.

1.	One graph for alpha-trim filter to compare its two methods (counting & selecting kth element)

2.	Another graph for adaptive median filter to compare its two methods (quick & counting).

How to calculate execution time?
•	To calculate time of certain peace of code:
1-	Get the system time before the code

2-	Get the system time after the code

3-	Subtract both of them to get the time of your code
To get system time in milliseconds, you can use System.Environment.TickCount

How to draw the graph?
•	See the example in the given code that draw a graph for two functions: N & N Log(N), using the Z-graph library.

•	To draw the timing graph:
1.	Create new object from ZGraphForm

2.	Construct x-axis by storing the values of different window sizes (3, 5, 7,… Wmax) in a double[] array.

3.	Construct y-axis by calculating the execution times of the filter at different window sizes (3, 5, 7,… Wmax) and store them in a double[] array.

4.	Add a new curve with x-axis and y-axis to the ZGraphForm using the add_curve function
